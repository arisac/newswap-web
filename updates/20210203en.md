NewSwap has been upgraded to 2.0. NUSDT-NEW liquidity mining launched on the mainnet at 8 o'clock (UTC+8) on February 3, 2021 Singapore time. The total amount of NEW allocated to NUSDT-NEW liquidity mining in the first phase is 30 Million, the mining will last for 30 days, and it is expected that subsequent mining plans will be released during this period.

NEP-40 proposes to add 3 kinds of mining behavior basing on the single NewPay NewForce mining during 2021/2/1-2022/1/31 , namely NewChain mainnet accounting node mining and mainstream asset transaction pairs such as NUSDT-NEW liquidity mining, community token-NEW trading pair liquidity mining. The launch of each content will reduce the number of NewPay NewForce mining. Among them, the total amount of mainstream asset trading pairs liquidity mining is about 260 million NEW, and NUSDT-NEW is the first mainstream asset trading pair liquidity mining project.

Combined with community feedback, the first phase of NUSDT-NEW liquidity mining in the mainstream assets trading pair liquidity is determined. Add NUSDT-NEW LP tokens to the mining pool on the NewPay or NewSwap liquidity mining page and mining will automatically start, the mining will be carried out according to the proportion of personal pledges to the total pledges.

The launch of NewSwap liquidity mining will enrich the and functions of NewSwap and bring more benefits to users. Combined with the NewBrige cross-chain mechanism, mainstream assets such as Ethereum can also be cross-chained to NewChain to start mining in NewSwap, maximizing the use of NewChain's advantages such as low cost, speed, and low threshold.
